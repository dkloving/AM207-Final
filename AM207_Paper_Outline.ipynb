    "In many practical applications of machine learning, data are not fully collected prior to model training but arrive in chunks, with accrual possibly over a long time period. For instance, a machine learning model for medical diagnoses may accomodate an initial set of patient data, but the model parameters may need to be further tuned as yet more clinical data are generated. Thus, a method to tweak predictive models using new data would be broadly applicable for a number of applications of machine learning.\n",

Furthermore, training of these models is prone to reach a suboptimal solution, especially .\n",

    "The paper is pretty short and centers around a single algorithm, explained in detail on page 2 and summarized on page 5. The algorithm depends on performing approximate variational inference, for which the authors discuss a number of techniques. We will focus primarily on using one of those (fully factorized gaussian approximation) and address others if time permits. The key demonstration is to take a pre-trained conventional DNN and update it with new data. The authors have done this on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and we plan to show how to replicate their results on MNIST, as well as attempting a non-image task if time permits.\n",

Each of these parts arrives sequentially during training. We implement a model that will train on the first $t-1$ parts ($\\mathcal D_1,...\\mathcal D_{t-1}$, then retrain it on the $\\mathcal D_t$-th part without have access to the first $t-1$ parts and taking into account dependencies.\n",

    "Kochurov et al. also make several approximations which help to increase their model performance in the paper - laplace approximation and stochastic variation inference. We briefly introduce both of these topics below, as well as a bit of the underlying mathematics that is being done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tangent 1 - Laplace Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the parameters for initializing the algorithm (creation of the bayesian model from standard DNN), We already know to use the trained weights as the initial means, but we also need to find the starting variance as well. Kochurov et al. propose either grid search or Laplace approximation, and ultimately implement Laplace approximation in their experiments.\n",

    "$$\\int_a^be^{Mf(x)}dx$$\n",
    "\n",

    "The reference that Kochurov et al. uses (Azevedo-filho, 1994) presents the integral formulation in the form\n",

    "\n",
    "(These are functionally identical - $g(x)$ must be twice-differentiable, and it is clearer why this is the case in the above expansion.) In the application outlined in Kochurov et al., Laplace's method is used to approximate parameters of posterior distributions - specifically, variance. The actual - and more helpful - approximation that is taking place in Kochurov et al. uses equation (14) from Azevedo-filho, 1994:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tangent 2 - Stochastic Variational Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the posterior distribution is intractable, so approximation must be done in more creative ways. The authors decide upon stochastic variational inference to approximate each weight.

    "In variational inference, the posterior distribution $P(\\textbf Z|\\textbf X)$ of some set of unknown variables $\\textbf Z = \\{Z_1,...Z_n\\}$ with some observed data $\\textbf X$ is approximated by a variational distribution, $Q(\\textbf Z)$. $Q(\\textbf Z)$ is restricted to the family of distributions that are simpler than $P(\\textbf Z|\\textbf X)$. The (lack of) similarity between Q and P is determined with a dissimiliarity function, $d(Q;P)$, and variational inference serves to minimize this function. A typical dissimiliarity function is Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL-divergence). It is defined as\n",

    "Instead of operating on the entire slice of data we are provided, we randomly sample from it (minibatches), and take statistics from those subsets of the slice, and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tangent 2, continued - Stochastic Variational Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic variational inference applies random sampling of $\\mathbf{X}$, and updating modeling parameters accordingly. Once the minimization of the dissimilarity function is stabilized (converged), we arrive at our approximation of the posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "All put together, our primary aim is to create a \"worst-case scenario\" version of the model, that implements the simplest facets of the multiple options provided in the paper (e.g. basic pre-train network, straightforward Bayesian network, with fully factorized gaussian approximation), and go on to explore alternative network structures and compare test accuracy. Our decisions are illustrated in the Implementation section below. Additionally, we completely ignore the posterior approximation, and set starting standard deviations to 1 for added simplicity."
